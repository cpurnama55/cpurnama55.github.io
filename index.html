            Welcome.
            <div class = "paragraph"> 
                Hi, my name is Caelan Purnama and I’m currently a student at Northwestern University 
                working on a bachelor’s in electrical engineering and master’s in computer engineering. 
                My primary interests are embedded and robotic systems 
                and I’ve worked on a bunch of projects during my university career that focus on this field. 
                I’m passionate about creating easy to use and helpful devices that can assist anyone with their daily tasks.
