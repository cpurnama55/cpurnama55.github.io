            <h2>DUM-E</h2>
            <p>Dum-E is a sentry turret created for one of my embedded system capstone classes (specifically Electronic System Design II). It is capable of pedestrian detection and can rotate its main camera to point at any detected individual. Besides this automatic detection mode, Dum-E is also capable of remote directional control through a web-socket based website.</p>
            <p>I worked on this project with two other teammates and my primary responsibilities were creating the pedestrian detection algorithm and designing the enclosure to hold all the electronic mechanisms as well as coming up with a movement system that would allow Dum-E to follow a detected person.</p>
            <p>The pedestrian detection algorithm was created using the OpenCV library in Python, and all enclosure parts were created in Onshape and printed out using PLA.</p>
