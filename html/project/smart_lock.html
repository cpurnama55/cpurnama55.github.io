            <h2>Smart Lock</h2>
            <p>The Smart Lock was created as part of my Internet of Things classâ€™s final project. The requirements for the final project were to create a device that would interface with the cloud, whether it be through telemetry or remote actuation.</p>
            <p>The Smart lock was created by wiring an ESP32 microcontroller to a DC motor. The ESP32 was then programmed using embedded C++ and connected to Microsoft Azure services. The connection was created via MQTT protocol. With this cloud connection, the device was able to provide telemetry (status of the lock) and was also able to receive commands from the cloud (lock/unlock). The enclosure for the device was created in OnShape and printed using PLA.</p>
